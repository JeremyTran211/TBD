        <p>
        Hi, my name is Aman Khera I am a fourth year Computer Science student at SF State. The idea for 
        this website was to create a platform where students can find affordable housing with compatible 
        roomates all in one spot as securely and efficiently as possible. It gives landlords the 
        space to rent out their properites as well to verified and background checked students.
